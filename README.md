![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c506d37e-eee3-4193-8224-f7f1b153211b)

Welcome to the repository for the **Bioinformatics** course project! This project was developed in collaboration with **Andrea Munarin**, **Davide Pizzolato**, and **Simone Jovon**.  

---

## 🎯 **Project Overview**  

The primary objective of this project is to understand and explain the mechanism behind the **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)** method proposed by **Carillo and Lipman**. This repository contains valuable resources, including key papers and the final presentation.

## 🧑‍🔬 **What is Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)?**  

**MSA** is a critical method in bioinformatics used to align three or more biological sequences (protein, DNA, or RNA).  
The approach by **Carillo and Lipman** is particularly notable for its:  
- **Optimization**: Reducing computational complexity by leveraging alignment constraints.  
- **Innovation**: Utilizing bounding techniques to efficiently find the optimal alignment.  

The method introduced significant advancements in bioinformatics, forming the foundation for many modern sequence alignment tools.
